Hello World!

I'm Albert ZHANG Tongjun. I am currently a computer science undergraduate freshman at National University of Singapore. 

Huge fan of C++ (sorry Linus), but can also code in C, Java, Javascript, Python, and Go.

As you can see, I more of a backend developer.

Open for any backend-related part-time (fulltime during summer and winter) job oppotunities.


PS: I'm currently single so ... yeah
