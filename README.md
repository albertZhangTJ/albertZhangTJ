Hello World!

I'm Albert ZHANG Tongjun. I am currently a computer science undergraduate junior at National University of Singapore.

Huge fan of C, but also have experience in C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Go, and SQL.

Specialized in network, operating system, security, and fuzzing. My current work is primarily on grammar-based fuzzing (see [here](https://github.com/albertZhangTJ/sqlancer-lancerfuzz)).


PS: I'm currently single so ... yeah
