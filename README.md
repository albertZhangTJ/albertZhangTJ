Hello World!

I'm Albert ZHANG Tongjun. I am currently a computer science undergraduate junior at National University of Singapore. 

Huge fan of C++ (sorry Linus), but can also code in C, Java, Javascript, Python, Go, and SQL.

Specialized in Operating Systems and network.

Open for any backend, OS, network related part-time (fulltime during summer and winter) job oppotunities.


PS: I'm currently single so ... yeah
