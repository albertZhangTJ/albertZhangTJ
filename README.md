Hello World!

I'm Albert ZHANG Tongjun. I am currently a computer science undergraduate senior at National University of Singapore.

Huge fan of C (call me a relic), but also have experience in C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Go, Rust, and SQL.

My research interest lies primarily in grammar-based fuzzing for RDBMS (see [here](https://github.com/albertZhangTJ/sqlancer-lancerfuzz)), but I am also generally interested in network, operating system, security, and fuzzing.


PS: I'm currently single so ... yeah
